      <p>White space is exceptionally used in this basic but clean UX design site. Because of the large amount of white space surrounding the mock up of the application, these designs almost instinctively become the focus of the page. And because of the limited amount of options to proceed one is guided to view the entire case study for this application.</p>
      
         <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>

       <p>Aside from the beautiful animations that this site boasts upon opening on mobile or web versions, the contrasting colors really make the design of the page stick out. Normally you would expect any website to be very perpendicular, but in this site the main banner graphic is always at an upward incline. Also the contrasting colors help the features of the site stick out so users know exactly where to press to progress into their site's content.  </p>
