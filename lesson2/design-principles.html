        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Lindy Moes Designs<br> <a href="https://www.lindymoes.com/"> https://www.lindymoes.com/</a></h3>

      <p>White space is exceptionally used in this basic but clean UX design site. Because of the large amount of white space surrounding the mock up of the application, these designs almost instinctively become the focus of the page. And because of the limited amount of options to proceed one is guided to view the entire case study for this application.</p>
      
         <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
         <h3>Panic Studio<br> <a href="https://panicstudio.tv/en/"> https://panicstudio.tv/en/</a></h3>

       <p>Aside from the beautiful animations that this site boasts upon opening on mobile or web versions, the contrasting colors really make the design of the page stick out. Normally you would expect any website to be very perpendicular, but in this site the main banner graphic is always at an upward incline. Also the contrasting colors help the features of the site stick out so users know exactly where to press to progress into their site's content.  </p>
    
       <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
       <h3>Tesla Motors<br> <a href="https://www.tesla.com/"> https://www.tesla.com/</a></h3>
    
       <img class="tesla" src="/lesson2/images/tesla.jpeg" >
       <p>Tesla motors has a very obvious and forward focus on their products first and formost. When viewing their site everything is aligned to center both vertically and horizontally. And in the very center of the page is their product. Whether this is solar panels for your home or a brand new model 3 the alignment of the page makes that the focus. And by removing all other background color or shapes the primary focus of their site is very clear. "Buy our beautiful product" </p>
